The term "constraint" refers to a **limitation or restriction** that affects how something can be done. For example, a **time constraint** can limit the duration available for completing a task, while a **resource constraint** may restrict the materials or funds available for a project. Constraints are important to consider in various fields, including project management, engineering, and law, as they can significantly influence outcomes and decisions.
