 I believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the meaning of "property" here. In English, "property" generally refers to something owned, not a characteristic. Some common meanings include:

- A piece of land or real estate
- A possession or asset
- A quality or trait

If you intended the meaning of "characteristic" or "distinctive feature", here are 4 collocations and example sentences:

1. Unique property
2. Defining property 
3. Essential property
4. Fundamental property

Present Perfect: 
Scientists have identified unique properties of the new material.  

Past Simple:  
He explained the defining properties of whale species yesterday.

Past Continuous:
Researchers were documenting essential properties of the artifact while excavating.  

Past Perfect:
The professor realized she had overlooked fundamental properties in her analysis.

Please let me know if you have a different intended meaning of "property" or need any clarification!
