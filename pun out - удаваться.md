# Pun out - удаваться

I'm afraid there is no common English idiom "pun out" that means "to succeed" or "to turn out well". Perhaps there was a mix-up with a similar phrase. However, here is my best attempt:
Collocations:

1. Work out well

2. Turn out fine

3. Have a good result

4. Accomplish successfully

Example sentences:
Present Perfect:The project has panned out excellently so far.
Past Simple: Our plan panned out perfectly in the end.
Past Continuous: Things were panning out well for us halfway through the season.

Please let me know if you have a different phrase in mind or if I have misunderstood the meaning you intended!
