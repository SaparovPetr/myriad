# Crave - жаждать


I crave our meeting.

And left me cravin' for more summer wine.

1. Crave attention
2. Crave chocolate
3. Crave success
4. Crave affection
5. Crave solitude
6. Crave a cigarette
7. Crave recognition

- She has craved recognition for her work for many years.
- He craved a cold drink after the long, hot run.
- They were craving pizza while watching the movie last night.
- I had craved that moment of peace long before I finally achieved it.
