Unfortunately I do not believe "inflax" is an actual English word. The closest word I could find is "influx" which means "an arrival or entry of large numbers of people or things".

Here are 7 collocations with "influx" to convey the meaning of "наплыв" (inflow, influx) in Russian:

Influx:

- sudden influx 
- huge influx
- steady influx
- enormous influx
- mass influx
- rapid influx 
- overwhelming influx

Examples:

Present Perfect:
There has been a huge influx of migrants crossing the border seeking asylum.

Past Simple:  
The new smartphone model saw a rapid influx of demand when it launched.

Past Continuous: 
The low interest rates were causing a steady influx of investors into the stock market.

Past Perfect:
The war had led to an enormous influx of refugees flooding neighboring countries.

Let me know if "influx" matches what you were going for or if you have another word in mind to explain the meaning of "наплыв". I'm happy to provide more suggestions!
