He was blamed for appropriate founds.

 I would not use "appropriate" as a synonym for "присваивать" (to misappropriate, embezzle, seize). Here are some alternative collocations with "appropriate":

- Appropriate funds
- Appropriate resources 
- Appropriate money
- Appropriate time

Example sentences:

Present Perfect: The organization has appropriated enough funds for the new project.

Past Simple: The government appropriated money for education last year.

Past Continuous: While the budget was still being finalized, departments were appropriating resources for their needs.

Past Perfect: The finance committee had appropriated time the day before to review the budget thoroughly.

The word "appropriate" here means to allocate or set aside, rather than to misuse or take illegally. Let me know if you need collocations to express that meaning instead!
