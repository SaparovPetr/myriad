The term "highbrowed" refers to someone who is **highly educated**, intellectual, and often perceived as sophisticated or elite. It can sometimes carry a slight negative connotation of being pretentious or overly intellectual. For example, a **highbrowed scholar** might be someone who is deeply knowledgeable but potentially disconnected from everyday experiences.

Interestingly, the term originates from the pseudoscience of phrenology, which suggested that a high forehead indicated intellectual superiority.
