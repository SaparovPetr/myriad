# Curiously - странно

Curiously, I saw her with the same boy.

Unfortunately "curiously" does not mean "странно" (strangely) in English. Here are some words that do convey the meaning of "strangely" along with some sample sentences:

Words meaning "strangely":

- Oddly
- Strangely
- Weirdly
- Peculiarly
- Bizarrely
- Mysteriously
- Curiously (means "with curiosity")

Examples:

Present Perfect:
She has acted peculiarly since changing medication.

Past Simple:
Oddly, the lights flickered right before the power went out.

Past Continuous:

Past Perfect:
A thick fog had mysteriously rolled in overnight before any storms hit.

Please provide the Russian word you'd like collocations for that matches the meaning of "strangely." I'd be happy to suggest appropriate English words and phrases to describe something strange or weird.
