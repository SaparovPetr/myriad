Please note that while "naughty" can mean "непристойный" (indecent or improper), especially in certain contexts, it often carries a lighter, more playful connotation in English. It can suggest mischievousness or mild impropriety, particularly when referring to children's behavior or lighthearted adult situations. For more serious contexts, words like "indecent," "obscene," or "lewd" might be more appropriate translations for "непристойный."
