This is Rock and Roll English. Real people.

Real English. Here's your host, Martin Johnson.
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Rock and Roll English. Episode number 346, baby. Oh yeah.
In today's episode we speak to the Hellraiser about... not a lot really, I mean, what else do we talk about on Rock and Roll English?
We talk about a lot, do we? So it's kind of about our hopes, dreams, life in general or just... that might be a nice way of saying we just talk about nothing, okay? Whatever you want to believe.
So before we get to the episode just to tell you this will be the last episode. I think before Christmas there will be the break and Rock and Roll English will be back after Christmas.
This early January I probably should have thought about the exact date before making this podcast but I haven't so apologies for that.
But if you are in the Rock and Roll English family do not worry because there will be lots of episodes over the Christmas period.
Anyway, I am going to stop talking now. Here is the conversation about not a lot. Oh, sorry. There are a few things I need to tell you.
So listening questions for you, okay? So a few things I have on my list here is number one. The Hellraiser was fidgeting a bit. 

Fidgeting is a great word, by the way. Moving around.
So there is some audio, very small problems-ish that's thanks to the Hellraiser's fidgeting.
Also, if you haven't listened to all of the podcasts which I imagine most people haven't I suppose, I don't know.
We do talk about some things which we have spoken about on episodes before which maybe we assume you know.
For example, the fact that I have a tattoo on my arse that says BJ. We talk about that. It doesn't actually say BJ to find out what it actually means.
Go back and listen to those old episodes so we do talk about that. And just one listening question.
Try to find out, try to listen carefully about measuring pencils. Okay? Measuring is the key word because we do talk about pencils a few times.
But measuring pencils. Okay? Who measures pencils? Okay? I will talk to you at the end. Happy listening.



Hellraiser, how are you today? Wonderful, mate. How are you?
Always fantastic, Hellraiser. Even more fantastic talking to you. Haven't maybe spoken to each other or seen each other since Valencia, have we?
A mad trip to Valencia? I think you're right. Yeah, it's been too long. A couple of messages here and there.
We did meet for a couple of hours, for one hour I think in Chelmsford. Remember we had that very specific time where I could only say 60 minutes.
We did have two beers. You had a very specific time. Yes, I remember that. I remember trying to get you to stay for one more.

Classic. And you were pretty resolute about having to leave something about family, kids and some bullshit.



Yeah, more thinking if I don't go home now, I may die. So went for the safe option, went home, everything was fine. And we had a great time. So everyone was a winner, Hellraiser.
How was average? It was average. Great to see that. It was good for you. It was average for me. I don't know.
I see that's a pretty good description of it, actually. Amazing for me.
You're just happy to get out of the house, I think. That's it, even for one hour. What an hour. So, Hellraiser, how do we usually start the show?
Reviews from Trusted Fans. Do you think we have one?
I don't know, it's been a bit a mess, hasn't it? I want to say yes. My heart is saying yes, but my head's saying no.
Lesson. Always listen to your head. Because we don't. Although I am actually recording this one day after I recorded the last podcast with Boom Boom.


For listeners, probably think, oh, that was so long ago, that podcast, but in real life, it was yesterday. So haven't had time for any more reviews.
So yes, please send them in. So we've got some general questions here.
Also, again, because I haven't had any time to plan another podcast, but just got some general questions about life to see what kind of person you are.






The real Hellraiser, we want to get to know the real Hellraiser and obviously the real Martin. Okay.
So first question I got, as always, from chat GPT, what was your dream as a child? Hellraiser?
Now, I'm maybe just going to suggest something, which I understood was your dream when you were a child. Was it to be a saxophone player?
I feel like you're putting words in my mouth now. You're going to tell me what my dream was as a kid. Was it to be a saxophone player?
That was one of them. You know what? I actually was thinking, so I said saxophone player because I didn't know the word.
You're shocking. You're supposed to be an English teacher. This is an English language podcast.
I mean, how often do you need that word?
Well, if I was going to be a word-famous saxophonist, quite a lot.
So how many years did you play the saxophone before again? Five good years.
Yeah.
Could you still belt out a few tunes on that?
I'd have to dust off the reeds.
Maybe do a few finger exercises.
No, no, no. Fingar exercises. So you actually do need to practice fingers when you are a saxophonist.
Saxophonist. Yeah.


So that's what you were doing before going to bed when you were like 12 or 13 doing finger exercises.
I mean, you can call it that. Probably something different.


But yeah, finger exercises. No, I was just practicing the sax, man.
Just, you know, in a smokey bedroom.
You're making it sound as if you were playing in jazz clubs when you were 12.


But what? That was it. I got my brother on the trumpet. He was seven.
Well, I think when you were 12, your brother was about one.
I'll get the time I was confused. I had maybe some trumpet on a tape in the background.
But anyway, I mean, to go back to your initial question, was my dream to be a saxophonist?
Probably, I wouldn't say it was the first dream. I think the first dream was to be a fireman.
A fireman? Who played a saxophone?
You know, coming a burning house that is, I would never mind if the fireman is going to play us a tune.
It's distracting everyone from the carnage. I bring it with me on my back to the fire.
Yeah, I think I was quite keen to be.
You are not manly enough to be a fireman.
I mean, not that I am either. I'm not saying, you know, that I am. I don't see either of us are.
I beg to differ.

Yeah, you think you could handle that?
I could handle a fire.
How many files have you put out?
Not many. That's the point. If I see a fire, I'd just run away.
I hope nobody just played the sax now. I don't put it.
If I hear a fire, I just put a bit of jazz.
But, yeah, no, no, no, you're right. Fireman are quite manly.
Generally speaking.
I've heard as well the main thing they're famous for is getting cat down from trees.


Did you read that on the internet?
I don't know.
I remember talking to someone at a party once about he was a fireman.
I was really impressed by this and then everyone was saying that.
I must admit his muscles were pretty impressive.
Even I was thinking like, that's all for just lifting cats.
Yeah, apparently.
You can't get really.
Did you ask him? Did you say to the fireman?
I thought he would not do rescue cats.
No, I was too scared of him. I thought he might punch me and break my nose.
I didn't really want to talk to him, to be honest.
Other people were talking to him. I was mainly in awe of his ginormous muscles.
Cool. Very cool.
Yeah, for me, the risk would be fireman.
Interesting. That was your dream.
For me, it was just beer footballer.
But still hope.
We went for different lifetimes.
I mean, there's probably fireman, saxophonist, footballer, rapper.
But that's gangster.
And then just a normal man.
I think after that, I think that describes your...
Well, fireman, footballer, saxophonist, rapper.
But then I think your dream was to just be homeless for a while.
That was your kind of weird phase, wasn't it?
That wasn't a dream. That was a reality.
That was something that I was facing and I had to make the best of it.

You managed to live your dream then.
Good job. I was playing the sax.
We got a better spare change.
All of these things are just coming together now, aren't they?
Exactly. Exactly. All makes sense when you look back at it.


Did you have a dream? You had one dream then to be a footballer.
So that's failed. I mean, at least I played the sax.
Well, I mean, on my birthday, Boom Boom sent me a picture of a Japanese footballer still.
57 still playing professional football in Japan.
So, you know, keep the dream alive.
Yeah, definitely. The key thing is still playing professional football.
Didn't start at 40.

But okay, any dreams now, her razor?
Just nightmares, really.
You interpreted that in the same way as chat GPT.


When I was saying, give me some questions about dreams, it was asking me like actual dreams,
like at night, but I was like, no dreams, like aspirations.
Hope's had dreams.
Hope's had dreams.
Yeah, nothing now.
That's it.
You've lived a dream of being homeless and playing the sax.
Where do you go from there?
There's nowhere. There's the only ways it's down.
What about you?
Well, I think maybe to be a famous podcaster, but again, not really sure.
Not really.


Well, I don't think so because I see, I talk to lots of people.
So I've been in the game a while now.
So like seven, nearly eight years.
And then you talk to so many people that, oh, yeah, I started my podcast or YouTube channel in 2021.
And they've got like 10 million subscribers.
How about you? Yep.
Similar.
Millions.
Millions.
But what subjects are they covering them?
Generally the same as me.
Okay, cool.
Good.
So it's the same, same genre.
Same genre, same everything, just much more popular and famous.
Living my dream, Hellraiser.
Stealing your dream.
Stealing it.
How can we get you there? What can we do?
I'll tell you what, my people, the lever review.
Okay. That's one thing that we can do.
Okay.
So another one now, obviously to see what type of person you are, we need to know.
Do you always remember things, Hellraiser, like birthdays?
Do you have a, are you a person as a calendar, like Google calendar for like, to go like grocery shopping on Saturday, you have that in your calendar 10 30 to 11 15 am.
I mean, my, my, my foolproof method is to write things I need to remember on pieces of paper.
And then I do that, but then I lose paper around the house and then spend quite a lot of time trying to look for the paper.
So yeah, it's a pretty good system.
Similar system to my, yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Yeah.
And then I'm still writing things down.
I don't like, I don't like to write things in my phone, you know, just feel like a proper list.
If you type it in.
I was just about to say the same thing.
There's, there's something about that pen and paper vibe, isn't there? You just can't.
I think I'll buy.
I mean, I write the pencil that you can see.
This is one of those extendable pencils.
This is what I write with.
I can't even use a pen.
Just random story popped into my mind.

Remember when we were in school, we used to break pencils on our head.
The idea you hold it was sort of left hand, right hand, head in the middle kind of head, but the pencil.
And then it would snap into.
That's the plan.
I know we were going with this.
I'm such a vivid memory of you trying to do that.
The pencil not breaking.
And then you just had this pencil line across your forehead, the rest of the day.
Always a good look to have a pencil line across your forehead, isn't it?
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
Just another reason for the, for the girls to love me.
Yeah, I forgot about that.


Thanks for bringing it up.
I did, I didn't think that story was going to come up.
I hadn't thought about that story in a long time, but very glad that.


Me too.
It's popped back into my mind of that.
It was almost like a tattoo of a pencil just perfectly across your forehead.
Maybe you're into tattoos.
Maybe you could, you could get that one.


It's a good idea.
It's a good idea.
Are you still into tattoos actually?
Is that still a thing?
Because again, was that always out just one of your phases?
Are you over that now?
I mean, it's a pretty stupid thing to have a phase about, isn't it?
Because they last quite a long time.
Yeah, true.
But the, at one point, I mean, you were going out on a night out on a Friday,
then you'd wake up with three new tattoos.
Yeah, that happens a bit less now.
But I normally plan them a bit more.
But yeah, I'm still in the game.
Still in the game?
Oh, yeah.
Big time.
You haven't, have you even more since you got BJ tattoo on your ass?
Well, I got the other one in Thailand, didn't I?
Of the, the dates I left for travelling.
And then they also mess that one up and just put the wrong date.
Well, at least you haven't got, um, dangerous written on your back.
Backwards.
In another language.
But can you even see that now with all of the other taps you've got?
Yeah.
Yeah, you could still see that one.
Thank God.
Right.
Okay.
I've thought about getting it covered up, but it's quite a, it's quite a good conversation to start.
Yeah.
No, that's the same for my BJ as well, actually.
Did many people see your ass these days?
Well, not really.
It's a good party trick though.
Again, like get, I get it out next now.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
So since I've started my new job, which was in January this year,
haven't mentioned the BJ tattoo on my ass, funnily enough.
Many of your colleagues, senior, are at the top.
No, hasn't, hasn't come up.
But I'm not sure.
I've been in the past, I've been in the past, I've been in the past,
I've been in the past, I've been in the past, I've been in the past,
but hasn't, hasn't come up in conversation, you know, whilst, you know,
at the water machine filling up my drinks bottle.
Was it when you asked out?
That could be something to think about.
Mm.
No, so that hasn't come up.
Um, but on, on the memory thing, one thing that, just when chat GPT gave me that question
that popped into my mind was how maybe even still now, but certainly until a few years
ago, every time we would meet up and you would see boom, boom, you would always say,
how is, how is life in the insurance game thinking he worked in insurance?
And he had literally never worked one day in insurance in his whole life.
Yeah, but it's that thing with like your close mates.
I have, you don't know what they do for work.
That is true.
And we've known each other for long, long, too long.
And, um, I mean, apart from, I know what you do because we're doing it right now, but apart
from that, I've got no idea.
All of the other people, no clue.
I'm not sure.
I still think that he measures pencils, but I'm sure that that's not true.
He kind of be doing that for 15 years.
Maybe, maybe his job of measuring pencils, he got into, he got inspired that day when that
pencil got tattooed on your head.
It's possible.
Yeah.
So Russ isn't in the, boom, boom, isn't in the insurance game.
Doesn't anymore.
Doesn't anymore.
It's good.
It literally never worked today.
I remember because when I lived with boom, boom, in London, and he used to complain about the
fact that every time we met up with you, you would always ask him this.
Well, that'll be one thing that I'll be sure to ask him when I see him next for our Christmas
get together.
I've got no doubt.
But okay.
So yeah, this is the whole, whole kind of life, um, interview, I suppose, here, how
razor.
So what about now?
It's, it's like a stupid question, but a question which I thought, you know what?
I don't know how to answer that.
Hobbies.
Hobbies now.
What are your hobbies?
Do you have hobbies?
I think that we should.
I mean, I mean, what do I do?
Exactly.
That is exactly my response.
Hobbies, you have got loads of them.
Yeah.
So many.
What are they again?
Walking.
I mean, that's one.
Reading.
Talking.
Breathing.
Yeah.
Now I've always done that.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Yeah.
Eating.
Drinking.
Having a shower.
I've got into, um, to sauna, sauna culture these days.
Sauna.
Oh yeah?
How'd you get into that?
Oh, he's going to go into the sauna, dip in the lake.
Oh right.
Get out.
Get your kicks off.
Jump in the lake, go for a swim, and then get in the sauna.
Wow.
I mean, that's, um, I was thinking, I remember being part of a gym once, and they had like
sauna and all of this, and I was thinking, yeah, this is a bit of me.
I think I just left university and so you go in the swimming pool
And then like sitting this sauna and it's really hot in there and then I just do it
Yeah, but I'm just sort of sitting there thinking what am I supposed to be doing here?
Do I need to take all my clothes off? Yes?
Well, I didn't want to know I stayed with swim shorts. Just leave a sock
It's a sock on it
I always stayed with swim shorts and but there were some naked people in there and
Whole experience was a bit uncomfortable for me. I'm not a fan of like have you ever been to like a spa?
I find like that like too much pressure of like you need to relax. Oh
I know I relax when I want to relax. I don't never make me relax
Yeah, so when your hobbies is not relaxing
Yeah, probably being stressed going bored
Yeah, those kind of cool hobbies that we picked up and what so you said read it. How often do you read?
Page of night a page tonight
They don't give her a book. I've been normally a couple of books on the go takes me about six months finish
Well, if you're reading a page a night
Yeah, I just read it and then you just fall asleep
I've been there and then you and not only that you read in the same page every night
Exactly that yeah, it's pretty cool
It's like I didn't plan this actually but I
as of two days ago have
Combination of things we've spoken about put in a 15-minute slot into my calendar to read to read
Yeah, I've got loads of stuff mate. Oh stuff. Oh, yeah
Manchester United treble winning you 1999
I've read that I'm reading at the moment a book called
What they don't teach you about money, okay, so trying to learn some stuff about money
But because one of the things I'm starting to think about retirement
Do you think about that much hell razor no never mean either and I remember a good few years ago now
Talking to one of our friends and he told me said yeah, I've got this like retirement fund
I put 650 pounds a month of it. I just think oh wow
Yeah, and also thinking
I I think I sort of stopped paying tax for about five years at least of my life and plus I've got tax paid in different countries
So I think my retirement fund at the moment is like minus
650 pounds. Yeah, it's gonna be it's gonna be pretty slim
I think I often find that the lesser think about those sort of things the better
Yeah, really good attitude I think
To anyone listening for any that's actually written in the book about money actually
Thinking about it stop thinking about it and then it will all be it'll be much better
Do you say anything about like going back to your
saxophonist dreams could actually be the best retirement fund
decision you've ever made
Yeah, that's also sometimes what I think about
Yeah
Strange how your financial advice is exactly the same as everything in this book
You know, I thought it should be writing financial book financial advice
Okay, so we are going to stop the episode there and continue it in the family area where as mentioned
There will be lots of episodes over the Christmas period with rocker roll English family members where I actually record podcasts with
Rocker roll English family members, but anyway, so first things first the measuring pencils that is called pukoma
Okay, that's what we say in our friendship group
I say we is more the hell raiser that says that because as you can imagine that is obviously not true
I'm not sure if that exists as a job measuring pencils
But I don't even know where that started
But that is a common thing which the hell raiser would often say to court pukoma apparently he measures pencils
When in reality, I believe he works in finance, but similar to the hell race. I don't really know what the head he does
So let's have a look at some of the vocabulary from today's episode
So the hell raiser said that when we met for beer a one-hour beer
He tried to make me stay but I was pretty resolute in the fact that I needed to go home
So if you're a resolute you are not going to change your decision
You are like no, I am doing this and I was like no I'm going home because otherwise
Mrs. R&R would kill me and we mentioned reviews and I said do you think we have a review hell raiser?
And he said well, it's been a bit hit and miss so far
So hit and miss meaning sometimes good sometimes bad you can't really predict it and lots of the other vocabulary
Quite obvious the meaning but some nice vocabular. I just want to highlight so the hell raiser said that
When we were talking about dreams and I said well
I think you want to be a saxophone player because I didn't know how to say sax soft honest
He said you are putting words in my mouth like you are deciding for me
And then I asked him can he still belt out a few songs and belt out like play a song with brilliant fuses
I'm like down down and something like that and he said yeah, I'll have to dust off the
saxophone so dust off is a lovely term we use as to talk about something haven't used for a while and
I mentioned how to be a fireman
The horizon was not man enough and he said I beg to differ basically saying I don't think what you said is correct
Notice as well when we were talking about being a fireman
You have to put fires out. That is what we say for fires. You don't switch off a fire
That sounds very strange. You put out a fire
And I mentioned about the fireman. I was in awe of his ginormous muscles
So if you are in awe you look at someone or something and say wow wow
that's what I was doing looking at his muscles and
Then the harraza mentioned about his full proof method for writing things down and losing the paper
Like it's so good. It's full proof and just some other little things when talking about saunas
I said yes sauna is a bit of me
I like that and talking about
Something which I can't remember and how I mentioned it was a good few years ago now meaning a long time ago
So that's it for this year. I will see you all again next year
Maybe I'll release another podcast before just to say happy Christmas and all that but in the meantime just keep on rocking the baby
