# Bother - потрудиться

- we must bother and do that

I'm afraid there seems to be a misunderstanding with the translation here. The verb "bother" in English does not mean "потрудиться" (to make the effort, to take the trouble to do something).
Some common meanings and collocations for the verb "bother" are:

1. To annoy or cause trouble to someone: e.g. "Stop bothering me with so many questions."
2. To make the effort to do something e.g. "She didn't even bother to call me on my birthday."
3. To worry someone by causing anxietye.g. "Something has been bothering him lately, he seems stressed."
   Some example sentences:  
   Present Perfect: I haven't bothered cooking dinner lately because I've been so tired.
   Past Simple:The noise from next door really bothered me when I was trying to work.
   Past Continuous: The kids were bothering their mother while she was on the phone call.  
   Past Perfect: The man seemed upset about something that had been bothering him for weeks.
   Please let me know if you need any clarification or have a different intended meaning for "bother" - I'm happy to provide more collocations!
