I apologize, but "anyhow" does not mean "по крайней мере" (at least) in English. "Anyhow" is used to indicate that something is being said despite previous remarks, to change the subject, or to resume a previous point.

Collocations with "anyhow":

1. anyhow or another
2. anyhow or other
3. anyhow, as I was saying
4. anyhow, moving on
5. anyhow, let's get back to
6. anyhow, the point is
7. anyhow, what I mean is

Examples:

- **Present Perfect**: Anyhow, I've **made up my mind** about the trip.
- **Past Simple**: Anyhow, he **didn't show up** to the meeting as planned. 
- **Past Continuous**: Anyhow, as I was saying, the project is **moving forward** nicely.
- **Past Perfect**: By the time we finished, anyhow, the deadline **had already passed**.
